The data collection feature will be used to collect data around the different processes that the business has. Below are some features and explanation of how it works.

1) The business will have access / control over which data that gets collected
2) structure : Collection model (name, description, frequency information)
               Collection model will have many fields which will be created by the business depending on the needs.

               More than likly will have to implement with postgres database (JSON / object coloum type)
3) Javascript implementation of the frequency to alert the user
	Maybe implement a time server to send notifications directly to the user depending on the frequecy 
4) Analyse data collected (rake task) inform user / business
    Create an algorithm that will analyse the data 
5) Report any information to user (emails, text messaging and notifications)
