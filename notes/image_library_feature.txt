Added Feature
--------------

to maximise the effiency and reduce storage costs, need to implement a library of images rather than upload am image everything. The user can select an image already in the library. Better security as only a select number of users can insert new images ... and reduce storage space. Also if parts of machine get upgraded, will update image in multiple places.

-> Fields Needed
--> image label (control panel to have extact same label - code system)
--> image and image details
